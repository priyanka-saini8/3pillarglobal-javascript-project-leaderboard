# 3PillarGlobal-JavaScript-Project-Leaderboard
Internship Mini Project (Completed)<br>
This project is hosted live [here](http://priyankasaini.rf.gd/3pillarglobal/leaderboard-mini-project/)

## Task
I was assigned a task to create a Mini Project named Leaderboard that looks similar to the one shown on this link [here](https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-JavaScript/blob/master/28_Day_Mini_project_leaderboard/28_day_mini_project_leaderboard.md).

## Functionality(To be included)
-	Add a person to the Leaderboard by mentioning their details and clicking on the Add Player button.
-	Remove a person from the Leaderboard by clicking on the Delete button right next to a player’s details.
-	Show an error message on the screen if any field is left empty while adding a player.
-	Increase/Decrease the score of a player by clicking on the respective button right next to a player’s details.
-	Arrange the Leaderboard by scores with the highest score being at the top.

## Functionality(Included as an extra feature)
-	I have used Plotly.js(a charting library) to build a line chart for keeping track of the variation in the score of the player.
- Used Media Queries to make the site responsive.

### The Page is Responsive
I have used Media Queries along with some CSS to make the site responsive so that it looks good on small screens(like Mobile Phones)<br>
